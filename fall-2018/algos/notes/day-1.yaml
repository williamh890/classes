Why Algorithms:
    - Core of computer science
    - Problem Solving Stragegies
    - Study of efficiency
    - Analytical Skills

What is an Algorithms:
    - sequence of unabiguos instructions and
      terminate in finite time

Algorithms:
    - Exact Approximate
    - Specification (Language, Pseudo-code, programming language)
    - Good (Efficiency, Simplicity, Generality)

    Note: efficiency with any resource (time, space, other...)

Problem Classes:
    - Sorting, Searching, String processing, graph,
      combinatorial, geometric, numerical

Data Structures:
    - Arrays+LL
    - Graphs (Adjacency Matxrix/List, Weighted Graphs, Rooted/Ordered Trees)
    - Sets+Maps

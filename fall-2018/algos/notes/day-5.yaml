Quiz:
    -  What to do about factorials
    -  Summation as ordinary sum vice versa
    -  Eval simple summs
    -  Recurrence relations
    -  The smoothness rule

Recursion:
    - Algo calls itself, must have base case

    Analysing Factorial:
        Recurrence: recurrence relation defines func in terms of itself

        Plan:
            - measuring input size
            - basic op, what case to analyz
            - setup recurrence
            - SOLVE recurrence

        Solving Methods:
            Forward Substitution: Starting with what you know calc successive values
            Backward Substitution:
                Using recurrence, express x(n-1) as a function of x(n-2) and substitute
                into original expression. Want to find x(n-i) then plug into initial
                condition

        Smoothness Rule:
            If: Eventually Non-decreasing and F is Smooth
            Then: T(n) is O(f(n)) for all n

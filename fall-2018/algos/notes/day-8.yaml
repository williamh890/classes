Closest Pair:
    Goal: Set of points, find closest 2 points
    Distance: euclidean distance, hamming distance, taxi cab
    Class: easy solution is O(n^2)

Convex Hull:
    Any 2 points in a set of points form a line segment inside the set

    Uses: Collisison detection, outliers, diameter
    Returns: A squence of points

    Solution:
        - brute force => O(n^3)
        - any 2 points in sequence where all points lie on
          on side of the line created by the 2 points

          y = mx + b =>
          y = x(y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) + 0

Exhaustive Search:
    Traveling sales person (TSP):
        Give list of cities, find shortest path to visit them all
        and end at the same city

        Note: Without euclidean distance is np complete

    Knapsack problem:
        Bunch of items with value+weight

        Solution: Need to generate subsets => O(2^n)

    Assigment problem:
        Brute force exponential

        Hungarian Method: fast solution polynomial

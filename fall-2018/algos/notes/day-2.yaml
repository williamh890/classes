Model of Computation:
    Measuring inputers: usually 'n', or 'b' for bits
        Numbers: num_digits = 1 + floor(log(k))
            Note:
                - lg (log base 2), ln (natural log), log (log base 10)
                - base doesn't matter

        Graphs: V for vertices and E for Edges

    What to count:
        Items: words, ints, bits? Edges or vertices?

        Running Time: basic operation (single op or class of ops)
        Running space: memory units (data items? pointers?)

        T(n) = c_op * C(n) # c_op is time for basic op, C(n) times c_op was executed

        Note: specify if not clear (size of input, basic operation)

    Order Of Growth: heights order term, ignoring constant infront of it
        Types:
            - Worst Case (Default)
            - Average Case (Over all inputs given a size)
            - Best case

        Amortized Efficiency: average over large num of consecutive execs

        Note: (p/n)(1+2+3+...+n) == n(n+1)/2

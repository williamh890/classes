Homework 2:
    Subsets:
        Finding all subsets is just counting up in binary

    Hint: Use backtracking to generate subsets

Quiz:
    What is dfs/bfs and what do they mean?


Search Spaces and Graphs:
    Representations:
        - Adjacency Matrix
        - Adjacency Lists

    DFS: Explore graph using stack
        Uses:
            - finds spanning tree of graph
            - connectedness

        Analysis: e = edges, n = vertices
            Matrix => n^2 + e => O(n^2)
            Matrix => n + e => O(n + e)
    BFS: Explore graph using queue

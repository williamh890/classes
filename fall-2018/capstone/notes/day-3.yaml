Incremental Devolpement:
    Pros:
        - Reduce cost of changing requirements
        - Allows for early feedback

    Issues:
        - Keeping docs updated
        - Pressure to produce new versions
        - System structure is hard to maintain
          (refactoring falls by the wayside)

Boehm's Spiral Model:
    - Mini waterfall, repeated over and over
    - Process is spriral instead of backtracking

    Note: Not used today but was a step in the right direction

Rise of Agile Methods:

        - High profile failures
        - internet moving to quick for waterfall
        - Businesses more reliant on software

    Goals:
        - Respond quickally to changing requirements
        - Focus on code instead of design (refactoring+architectural refactoring)
        - Deliever quickally

    Agile Manifesto:
        - Individuals and interactive
        - Working software

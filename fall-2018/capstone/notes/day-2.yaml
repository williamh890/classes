Software Process:
    - Specification (HARD) -> Implementation -> Validation -> Evolution

    Waterfall Model:
        Method:
            Requirements Definition: Reqs Document
            System+Software Design: Plan Document
            Impl+Unit Testing: Actual coding
            Integration+System Testing: uses Testing Plan Document
            Maintenance/Evolution: Modify Software+Update documents

        Issues:
            - difficult to respond to change
            - large projects with little communication

        Pros:
            - Cost of failure is extreamly high
              e.g. NASA, Flight Control

    Rapid Prototyping:
        Method:
            - Prototype to demonstrate concepts
            - Discard prototype
            - Now Waterfall for real thing

        Issues:
            - Cost of requirements is high

What is Software Engineering, and why is it worth while?:
    As computers become integrated more and more peoples lives and busnesses, the
    complexity of software requirements increase. Instead of small teams, working on
    small, focused software programs whole companies are devoted to developing one
    program. With this increase in scale and complexity comes many challenges. Software
    engineering is focused on solving, or at least lessening, these challenges.

    Many tecniques and methods used when devoping on smaller systems break down or degrade
    entierly. How do you handle the kind of traffic that Google, Netflix, or Facebook has?
    How do you stay agile in a rapidly changing market, and keep an upper hand on your competitors?
    How do you deligate work when there are hundreds of developers working on a single project?
    Architectures, Design Patterns, Performance, Scalability all become vitily important
    when tackling these challenges and all are related to software engineering.

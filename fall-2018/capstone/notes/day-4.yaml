Lean Software Development:
    Principles:
        - Eliminate waste, amplify learning, decide late, deliver fast,
          empower team, build integrity in, see the whole

        Eliminate Waste:
            - everything not adding value (compelxity)
            - knowledge loss
            - waiting/multitasking

Kanban:
    - Vis. flow of work
    - minimize work in progress
    - devs pull work
    - customer focused

Don't Make Me Think:
    Usability Consultant:
        - evalutates interfaces
        - determines where users will get confused

    Extremely Rare Bread:
        - This ends up being the teams responsibility

    Usablity:
        - Average person can figure out how to accomplish something with
          it being more trouble then its worth.

        Dont Make Me Think:
            - get it, without thinking about it
            - make buttons obvious

        Take Advantage Of Convensions:
            - visual hierarchies
            - clearly break up page
            - make items purpose obviouse
            - format content to support scanning

        Omit Needless Workds:
            - 'happy talk' no one is going to read
            - instructions are a source of needless words

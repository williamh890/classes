Pipelining:
    - slow to start and end
    - branching incures this cost.

    Branch Prediction:
        - is very poor.

    Superscalar Execution:
        Idea:
            more than one instruction per clock cycle.
        - multiple alu's, branches.
        - cpu tries to figure out how to make your code
          make use of all these alu's in parallel.

    Two Forms of Parallelism:
        - pipelining
        - superscalar

    Loop Dependenices:
        - acculmulatng value on registe (register dependenice).
        - pushing and poping values (stack carried dependenices).

    Summary:
        - register renaming
        - superscalar (multiple)
        - branch prediction

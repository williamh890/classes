Edge Trigger vs Level Triggered:
    Level:
        - high when clock is high.
    Edge:
        - only is high when clock has changed.
        Implementation:
            - have a slow clock
            - when clock is low and slow clock is high then
              the clock is triggered.

        Note:
            - edge trigger stops oscillation in the circuit.
            - reading inputs while also changing them is bad.

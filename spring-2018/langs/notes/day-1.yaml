Class: Programming Languages

Goals:
    - Syntax and Semantics
    - Basic lexical analysis, parsing, and interpretation
    - Know the different kinds of programming Languages
    - Know features from different languages and be able
      to code in them.

Topics:
    - Syntax and Semantics
    - Programming Language Features/Categories

Real Topics:
    Dynamic:
        - Something that happens at runtime
        example: 'new' keyword in c++

    Static:
        - Something that happens before runtime
        example: globals in c++

    Syntax:
        - is the correct structure of code
        example: c++ (good) a + b, (bad) a b

    Semantics:
        - the meaning of code
        example: operator+ gets called

    Conundrum:
        - 3+string("abc") semantics or syntax problem?
        - Static semantic problem

Formal Languages and Grammars:
    string: finite sequence of zero or more characters
    formal language:
        - a set of strings
        note: not a programming language!

    Alphabet:
        - characters alowed to be used in the languages strings.

        notation:
            "abc" => abc
            "" => epsolon (means the empty string)

        Example Language:
            - { abc, xyz, q }
            - { epsolon, 01, 0101, 010101, ... }
                Alphabet: language over the alphabet { 0, 1 }
            - Set of all valid c++ identifiers

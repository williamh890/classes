Dynamic Programming Languages:
    History:
        Automate Computer Tasks:
            scripts, scripting languages.
        Shell Scripts:
            running consecutive commands in shell.
        Perl:
            one of the first scripting languages, initially used as backend langs.

    Characterisitics:
        - dynamic type checking. Type errors get thrown at runtime.
        - sysinct syntax.
        - everything is mutable.
        - high level.
        - batteries included.
        - basically imperative.
        - usually OO.

Lua:
    - simple syntax, small feature set.

    Duck Typing:
        - looks like a duck, swims like a duck, then it is a duck.
        - only needs the defined interfaces.

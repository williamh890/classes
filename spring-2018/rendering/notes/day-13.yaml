Shadow Mapping:
    FBO:
        Frame Buffer, Texuture Object

    make():
        allocat texture:
            texImage2D: researves empty texture with enough space

        attach texture:
            framebufferTexture2D

        Projection:
            Orthogonal: Use this for sun lights
            Perspective: Use this for spotlights, and lights that are up close to shadow casting object

    In shadow map frag shader:
        SunShadowBiasMatrix = maps values from 0 -> 1 to -1 -> 1

        Shadow Text Coords: 0 -> 1
        Screen Coords: -1 -> 1

        - Allows screen coords to be looked up in the texture coordinate

    Percentage Closer Filtering (PCF):
        - gives the effect of softer shadows by doing convolutions on the shadow sample

More On Shadow Mapping:
    View Sample and Shadow map don't always line up.
    Check:
        - is shadow sample closer than the view sample to the light source.
        - if yes, then its in shadow.

    Bias:
        - add bias to view sample to compensate for artifacts from discritization.
        Gotcha (Light Leakage):
            - adding the bias to the view at a sharp vertex(corner).
            - this can cause points around corner to not be in shadow when they should be.
            - the bias pushes the view sample around the corner.

        Gotcha:
            - light can jump through surface if large bias and thin surface.

        Solution:
            - render normal maps with either front or back faces.

    Rendering:
        - Pcenter + dVsundir
        - shadows are rendered in an orthographic projection
        - lookat(eye, center, up)
          (eye == vector pointing from sun)

    Filtering:
        - used to soften shadow edges.

G-Buffer:
    render to texture technique

    idea: save computations for later
        - normals, albedo, specualr, depth

    Two shaders:
        NPR G-Buffer:
            - FBO with color and depth, render to color and depth textures
            - this is essentially the image with no shadows
        NPR Shader:
            - Bind color/depth texture
            - iterate through lights and use their contributions

    DOF:
        mip maps to blug image down, blend mip maps based on depth

    Edge Detection:
        - do a convolution on the depth buffer to see if the pixel is an edge
        - low variance -> no edge, high variance -> edge

HW 2:
    due next week on saterday.

MicroFacets:
    Specular Surface:
        - perfectly smooth reflector
        - all then energy coming in is reflected in one direction.

        example: mirror

    Diffuse Surface:
        - when light reflects, it bounces off in ecery direction.

        example: a wall (the same color whatever direction you look at it)

        Lo = 1/pi * Li * cos(theta) // 1/pi == Light being reflected out in all directions
        ro = absorbtion factoro

        Diffuse Illumination Formula:
            Lo = ro/pi * Li * cos(theta) // this takes into account absorbtion of the wall.

            note: this may look dark w/ no ambient light.

    Specular Reflection:
        BRDF:

            Fr = D(theta_halfangle)F(theta_difference)G2(theta_in, theta_out) / 4cos(theta_in)cos(theta_out)

            note: this goes to infinity when glancing angle and out angle both approch 0

            D:  distribution of microfacets away from maximum reflectance.
                - can be smooth gausian (wide/skinny) this affects roughness.
                - affects the specular highlight of the surface.
            F: Fernel reflectance
                -   What part of fracted/ what part is reflected.
                formula:
                    - r_perpendicular = n_t * cos(theta_t) - n_i * cos(iheta_i) /
                                        n_t * cos(theta_t) + n_i cos(theta_i)

                    - r_parallel = n_i * cos(theta_i) - n_t * cos(theta_t) /
                                   n_i * cos(theta_i) + n_t cos(theta_t)

                    F = .5 * (r_parallel ^2 + r_perpendicular ^ 2)

                Schlick's Approximation:
                    F(theta_d) = F0 + (1 - Fo)(1 - cos(theta_d))^5

Ray Tracing:
    Step 1: Making an Image
        P3              (format)
        3 2             (width height)
        255             (max color value)
        0 0 0 255 255 255 0 0 0
        255 255 255 0 0 0 255 255 255

    Step 2: Math Library
        Required:
            vector: class 3 components (x, y, z)
            ray class:
                origin, direction

    Step 3: Camera, Rays, Object
        - shot rays into scene
        - calculate direction of ray

        Subpixel:
            each pixel needs hundreds/thousands of rays to look good

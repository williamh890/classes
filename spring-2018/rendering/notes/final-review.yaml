Final Review:
    A non-photorealistic lighting model for automatic technical illustration:
        - phong is bad for rendering techniacl illistrations
        - use different color palets

    Rendering of unbounded volumes:
        - ray marching

    Distributed Ray Tracing:
        - Jitter rays at pixel level
        - average out over multiple rays
        Soft Shadows:
            - sample light source from area light for soft shadows

        Outcomes:
            - aliasing
            - glossiness
            - depth of field
            - motion blur

    Monte Carlo Method:
        Lo = Le = + integrat{sphere}(fr * li * N.L dow)

        - Randomly decide weather to reflect or refract a ray at each step

    Bidirectional BRDF:
        - shoot rays from both camera point and light lource
        - connect rays up at the end

    Perlin Noise:
        - smooth random numbers

    Edge Detection:
        Sobel, Prewitt, Robert's Cross

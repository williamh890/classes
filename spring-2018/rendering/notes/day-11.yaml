Light and Shadows:
    What is a shadow?:
        - area w/o light

    Parts of a Shadow:
        Umbra:
            - completely dark part of shadow.
        Penumbra:
            - transition of shadow to no-shadow,
              this is caused by light being cast by area's of light
              and not points of light.

    Properties:
        Hard:
            - no/little Penumbra, had edge to shadow
        Soft:
            - soft transition between

    Background:
        Shadow Mapping:      Williams 1978
        Ray Tracing:         Whitted 1980, Appel 1968
        Shadow Volumes:      Crow 1977
        Projection Shadows:  Blinn 1988
            - flatten object onto ground and draw it as a shadow.
            - Simple/Computationally Cheap
        Radiocity:           Greenberg 1986
            - Aka Spherical harmonics, ... Other names

# See lecture notes for diagrams
Ray Casting/Tracing:
    - Trace a ray from light source to the point that's being shaded

    Note:
        - This makes sharp shadows.
        - numerical accuracy

Radiosity:
    - form factors
    - hemi-cubes
    - scene geometry subdivision
    - Several iterations to converge on equilibrium.

Shadow Mapping:
    note: great for real time rendering

    Process:
        - Render scene from point of view of light source.
        - Render scene using light depth map.

        Details:
            - limited precision in depth buffer (pixels).
        Issue: z-fighting
            solution:
                - adjust-range to be as close as possible to object.
                - Adjust resolution of depth buffer (width/height) # more accuracy on edges of shadows.

            Alternatives:
                - midpoint algorithm

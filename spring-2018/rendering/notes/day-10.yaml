Bline-Phong BRDF:
    Fernel Equations:
        fr = F(omega_d)D(omega_h)G_2(omega_o, omega_i, omega_h) /
                    4 * cos(theta_i) * cos(theta_o)

    Snells Law:
        n_1, n_2: index of refactions.
        n_i * sin(theta_i) = n_2 * sin (theta_t)

        theta_t = arcsin(n_1 / n_2 * sin(theta_i))

        Baseline Fernel:
            F_o = (n1 - n2 /) ^ 2
                   (n1 + n2)

    Laws Of Reflection:

        Distribution of Visible Normals:
            D(omega_h)
            desctirption:
                omega_m = microface normals
                integrate [hemisphere] (omega_m dot omega_g) * D(omega_m) d omega_m = 1

                Note: Projected light area should match the area on the surface.


        Masking-Shadowing Function (G or G_2):
            G_2(omega_o, omega_i, omega_h)

            G1 and G2 difference:
                - G1 only takes into account outgoing illumination.
                  this is not realistic, some light is lost on incoming light.
                - G2 handles incoming and outgoing light.

Diffuse BRDF:
    lambertion illumiation model:
        fe = how much incoming light is going to be leaving.
           = outgoing light / incoming light # (Lo, Li) <= 1
        Lo = fe * Li
        Kd = diffuse color

        fr = fe / pi

        Perfectly Rough Surface:
            Lo = fe / pi * cos(theta_i)

            note: doesn't take into account any kinds of reflection.

    Oren-Nayer:
        - numerical model, v cavities # vvvvvvvvvv <- surface
        - individual v cavities are perfectly rough reflectors.

        Equation:
            fr = ro / pi (A + (B dot max[0, cos(pi_i, pi_o)] * sin(alpha) tan(beta))

            A = 1 - .5 (x^2 / (x^2 + 0.57))
            B = 0.45 * (x^2 / (x^2 + 0.09))
            alpha = max(theta_i, theta_o)
            beta = min(theta_i, theta_o)

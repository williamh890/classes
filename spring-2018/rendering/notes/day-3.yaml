Vector Class:
    Addition/Subtraction:
        - element wise
    Negation:
        - Make negative copy
    Scaling:
        - mult all terms by scaler
    Dot Product:
    Cross Product:
    Length:
        - Euclidean Distance
    Normalize:
        - return unit vector

Finding Orthogonal:
    A X B = | ay*bz - az*by | (x)
            | az*bx - ax*bz | (y)
            | ax*by - ay*bx | (z)

Matrix:
    Multiplacation:
        - A*B = (AB)_ij = sum([A_ik*B_kj for k in range(m)])

    Transpose:
        - Flip rows and columns
        note:
            - this is true for th rotation matrix,
                A_-1 = A_T if det == 1

            Scaling makes det != 1

    Matrix Class:
        Possible:
            - Addition/Subtraction
            - Negation
            - Scaling
        Definite:
            - Multiplacation
            Matrces:
                - Translation Matrix
                - Scaling Matrix
                - Rotation Matrix // Give axis and angle
                - Orthogonal Projection (ortho) // No perspective at all (2d).
                - Perspective Matrix //

            Note:
                - column vectors represent what direction each axis is pointing in.
                  | 1 0 0 0 |
                  | 0 1 0 0 |
                  | 0 0 1 0 |
                  | 0 0 0 1 |
                    x y z w-axis

            Rotation:
                Big ugle deriation.

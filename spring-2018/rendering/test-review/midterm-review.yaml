Math:
    Angle Between 2 Vectors: dot product
    In between vector: vector addition
    Perpendicular: cross product
    Determine xes of a coordinate system from a matrix:
        look at the column vector of the matrix

        Scaling Matrix: diagonal matrix

    How to rotate normals so they are in world space:
        - Use the INVERSE-TRANSPOSE matrix
        Note:
            Really is Inverse USING the transpose

        Note: if det of 3x3 mtx == 1, inverse is just transpose
            - Scale okay if all weights are the same

    Move from world space to coordinate to view-space or light-space:
        - also use inverse matrix for this
        - the inverse of the camera matrix or light-space

    lookAt Matrix:
        - inverse of rotation matrix == transpose

Scenegraph:
    What is a SceneGraph?:
        - Directed Acyclic Graph
    Adding Children:
        - uses parents transformation to position its elements
    Simpilest Impilmentation:
        - list of objects that are not related

Rendering Equation:
    Six Parts:
        - L_o(x => w_o) = light going from point x to the view = what the color of the thing should be.
        - L_e(x => w_o) = light emitted from the object
        - integrale = treat every incoming angle as a potential light source
        - fr(w_i, w_0) = Bidirectional re
        - Li(wi -> x) = light coming in from a direction in the integrale
        - <w_i, w_g> = NdotOut = how much light is reflected off the surface = how much does incoming light match normal?

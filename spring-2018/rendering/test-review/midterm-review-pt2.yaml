More on Inverse Transpose:
    (AB)^-1 == B^-1 A^-1
            also
    (AB)^T  == B^T  A^T


BRDF (Bidirectional reflect):
    Diffuse: rough surfaces
        - light getting scattared in all directions
        note: rho == absorbtion of material (color)

        Types:
            - Lambertion: rho / pi
            - Oren-Nauyer (dusty):
                note: if absorbtion == 1, then same as lambertion
            - Disney (velvety):
                - uses fernel to determine how light scatters
                - not physically based


    Specular: mirror surfaces
        V-Cavities:
            Blinn-Phong: cos^e(half_angle)
                straight guassian distribution of v-cavities, easy to impiment
                e = roughness
                if e is high:
                    more diffuse
                if e is low:
                    larger specular highlight
            GGX: Trobridge-Reich
                - elipsoid reflectors instead of v-cavities, harder, better for different materials
                - good for car paint

    5 angles:
        Incoming light   (omega_i)
        Outgoing light   (omega_o) == direction to eye
        Half Angle       (omega_h) == || omega_i + omega_o || where the specular highlight will show up
        Geometric Normal (omega_g)
        Difference Angle (omega_d) == || omega_i + omega_h ||

    Parts of BRDF:
        - Distribution of Microfactes  D(omega_h)  determines size of specular highlight, materials roughness
        - Fernel Effect                F(omega_d)  high reflectance at glancing angles
        - Masking Shadow Function      G2(omega_i, omega_o) masking and shadowing on the microfactes
            G2 takes into account both incoming and outgoing light for masking and shadowing

    Physically Based Requirements:
        Conservation of Energy:
            - never get more reflectance, than the amount of light that comes in.
            - Disney BRDF breaks this
        Reciprocity:
            - swap incoming, outgoing angles, result should be the same
        Positivity:
            - negative relectance is not possible

        For Microfactes:
            Conservation of Projected Area:
                - mirco facets don't add area to the reflection
                - this is due to shadowing masking function


    Shadows:
        Shadow Mapping:
            - applied after effect that produces shadows
        Ray Tracing:
        Path Tracing:
        Radiocity:
            - simulate flow of light from surface to surface
            - split scene up into patches and calculate flow of light at each patch
        Shadow Volumes:

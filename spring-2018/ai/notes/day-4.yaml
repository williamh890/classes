Evaluating Search Tree:
    - Search nodes based on which nodes are the best.

Network Topology:
    Topologies To Time:
        32-40-10-1:
            piece count: include input nodes in output.

        32-40-10-1:     weight
            sum(pieces) ------> output node

Training:
    - train at 4 ply
    - play at 6/8 ply

      apha-beta pruning

Move:
    - minimax function
    - generate nodes
    - leaf -> bef

Another technique: Iterative Deapening Search

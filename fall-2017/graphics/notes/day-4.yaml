Transformations and Animations:
    Transformations:
        - The main step that occurs in vertex transformations
        model/view: orient size/pos of object or the camera
   
        Types:
            resetMatrix, translate, rotate, scale

            resetMatrix:
                sets model view transformations to an empty one

                note: transformations are stored in 4x4 matrices

            translate:
                - x and y are added to the x and y coord of vertices
                - used to position objects

            rotate:
                - takes an angle in radians
                - rotates all subsiquently drawn points about the origin

            scale:
                - multiply all objects draw by a scale factor
                - used to change the size of objects

            note: default order
                - translate, rotate, scale

    Animations:
        - simulating motion by changing objects in an image
        - each change is a frame

        Handling Elapsed Time:
            millis() -> return in giving number of milliseconds since the
                        start of the program

            note: Instead of animating by frame, animate by time elapsed.
                
                pos += vel * elapsed_time

            note: Initializing of previous tim should be done in setup
            TODO: put upperbound on ellapsed time.

        Acceleration:
            - calculate the position with the old velocity by the average of the 
            - old velocity and the new velocity

            Damping:
                when something hits a wall, don't add acceleration.

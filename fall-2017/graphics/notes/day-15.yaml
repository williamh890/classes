Overview:
    - Texture Examples 

    Texture related effects:
        - reflection mapping 
        - refraction mapping
        - Drawing fuzzy blobs
        - Perlin Noise (procedural textures)
        - Billboarding
        

Reference:
    - All the steps to make a texture in webgl.

Drawing Fuzzy Blobs:
    Things to do:
        - generate texture image
        - use the texture in rendering, [application, shader (mostly fragment shader)]
    
    Drawing: 
        - looks same from every direction  
        - to draw, make a picture           |
          picture always faces camera       |->  Billboarding


Billboarding:
    - always face texture/polygon towards camera
    - every animation frame

    Types:
        Cylindrical Billboarding: 
            can rotate around 1 axis.
        Spherical Billboarding:
            rotate any direction, don't care which way is up.
        Oriented Spherical:
            same as spherical, but care about up direction.

    Spherical Billboarding:
        - have polygon w/ normal vector (n) and target (c)
        - angle to rotate is arccos of the dot of 2 vectors (if n and c are unit vecs)
        - line to rotate is cross product of normal and target ( n X c )
        Note: 
            - working in object coordinates
            - rotation happens around obj origin

        Problem: 
            - how to find vec pointing to camera in object coords
            - whereAmI in quoll.js

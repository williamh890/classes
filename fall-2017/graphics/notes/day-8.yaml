Manipulating Objects:
    object coordinates:
        - origin is natural center of object.
    
    world coordinates:
        - coodinates that are shared between all objects in world.

    note: 
        - translates, rotates, scales all end up in the same matrix
        - this is done with matrix mult. (they are composed together)
        - this can also be applied to a vector with one matrix operation.
        
        +--------+--------+---------+---------------+
        | matrix | matrix |  matrix | vector/matrix | 
        +--------+--------+---------+---------------+
        |                                           |
  World Coordinates                         Object coordinates

    transform in world coords:
        - save A.
        - set matrix to B.
        - multiply saved A on the right.

    copy matrix:
        - mat4.clone(m) // returns copy of matrix

Interactions in Processing:
    Events:
        An action by the user or the outside world.

        Examples: Keypress, mouse down/up, mouse movement, focus, timer elapsed,
                  redisplay needed
        
        Note:
            GUI's usually event-driven (stuck in an event loop)

        Callbacks:
            Event loop outside the program, functions only called when event 
            occures
            Examples: Setup, callback

            Rules:
                - Never call callback functions
                - Dont change global data in draw
                - No other function draws (except when timing things)

    KeyPress:
        Just need to write a function with the proper name.

        Function: keyPressed
            - Takes no params and returns void
            - varibale key holds the ascii value
            - Write keypressed as switch statement
              
        Example: void keyPressed() { switch (key) { case 'a': break; }}
        
        - Only communication can be down through global variables.
        - Dont draw in the event function.
    Mouse:
        Callbacks:
            mousePressed, mouseReleased, mouseDragged, mouseMoved
            
        global varibales: mouseX, mouseY (store mouse possition)

Triangle Strips:
    Different ways to connect and draw vertices.

    Syntax: beginShape() ... endShape()

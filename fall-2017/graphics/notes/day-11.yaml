Assignment 4:
    - make fog on on the field of cubes.
      The farthest cude should be just about grey.
    - also write another application using one of Chapells shaders

Polygons:
    - every polygon in view either front facing vs. back facing.

    FF: 
        - Vertices appear in cc order
    BF: 
        - Vertices apear clockwise.

    Concept:
        - easiest way to think about it is a triangle strip.
        - the stip has a front side and a back side.

Intro To Splines:
    Spline:
        - made up of segments, thought of as being smooth.
        - derivatives at intersetion at each segment is the same.
          
        Segment:
            - each segment has its own formula (usually polynomials)
            - allow for local control to overall spline.

        Control Point:
            - usually low per segment.
            - allow splines to be saved with small amounts of data.

Bezier Curve:
    - not a spline, used as a segment.

Bezier Spline:
    - usually made up of segments.
    - each segment is either a 3 or 4 point bezier curve.

    Requirments:
        - last point of 1st segment needs to meed up with 1st point of next segment 

    Good properties of these curves:
        Convex hull property (YES):
            - curve lies in the convext hull (shrink wrapped area) 
              of its conrol points.
        Interpolateing (NO):
            - curve interpolates through all control points.
        Smooth (YES):
            - means what you think (same derivate at segment intersections)

        Affine Invariant (YES):
            - affine transformation on control points generates same curve
              as transform done on curve itself.

            side note (Affine Transformation):
                - a linear translation plus a translation

                Examples:
                    - move, scale, rotate
                    - reflection
                    - shear (slanting object)
            
        Local Control:
            - bezier curve (NO), B spline (YES)

        Degree of Polynomial: 
            quadratic b curve:
                3 control point
            cubic b curve:
                4 control points

Bernstein Polynomial:
    - essentially binomial.

Bezier Surface:
    Patches:
        - this is what surfaces are made up of.

    Method:
        - Take points from row and generate curve for each
          parameterized from t=0->1
        - make a curve with control points from every row using 
          all values of t.

        Note:
            - good to conceptualized, bad for drawing.
            
Hermite Forms:
    - to specify curve, gives points and derivate at those points.

    Example:
        - 2 points, 2 derivates -> exactly 1 curve.

Cardinal Spline:
    - arbitrary number of points/segments.
    - each point sepcified in hermit form (point/derivative).

    Example:
        - f(0) = P2, f`(0) = k(P3 - P1)
        - f(1) = P3, f`(1) = k(P4 - P2)

    Tension (k):
        how sharp the segment intersections are.

    Properties:
        - doesn't have convex-hull property
        - does goe through every point.

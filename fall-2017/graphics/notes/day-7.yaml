WebGL:
    Primitaves:
        - 7 primitaves
        - POINTS, LINES, LINE_STRIP, LINE_LOOP, TRIANGLES, TRIANGLE_STRIP, TRIANGLE_FAN 
        notes:
            - no stroke/fill distinction
            - no primitaves w/ more than 3 vertices
        
    Terminology:
        attribute: property of a single vertex
            exapmles: coords, draw color

        uniform: property of a primative as a whole
            exapmles: model/view transformation, line width
    
    State Machine:
        - set states (color)
        - the state is stored.
        - retains value until its changed.
        - when rendering is done, current state is used.
    
    Drawing Primatives:
        - webgl version is complicated.
        - use chappells wrapper, primBegin(g1, g1.TRIANGLES), primVertex(g1, x, y) ... , primEnd(g1)
        - primColor(g1, 0.6, 0.4, 0.8)

3D: 
    Future Topics:
        - hidden surface removal
        - transformations and viewing
        - how to do lighting

    Axises :
        - x and y are nomal
        - z points out of the screen

    Coloring:
        painting: the color of the object
        lighting: changing the paint color to simulate lighting


    Geometry-Bound:
        vertex processing slowing down performance
    Fill-Bound:
        fragment processing is slowing down performance

        HSR Algos:
            Painters Algo (PA):
                - new pixel colors replace old, back-to-front
                note: 
                    works well with translucence
            Reverse Painters (RPA):
                - already draw pixels are never changed, (front-to-back)
                note:
                    each pixel is only set once. can be more efficient

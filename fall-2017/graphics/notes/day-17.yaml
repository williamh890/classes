Reflection Mapping:
    Methods:
        Too simple:
            - line-plane intersection behind camera.
            - take where the reflection of camera vector on the surface 
              intersection with this plane
        Sphere Map:
            - have sphere of all possible reflection angles
            - add <0,0,1> too the reflection vector

            note: Values around the edge of sphere, 
                  where direction change rapidly can create artifacts.

        Issues:
            - rendering to a texture.
            - make and user a cube map 
              (six 2d textures arranged logically to form a cube).
              we are inside the cube.

Rendering to 2D texture (RTT):
    termonology:
        framebuffer:
            - where the data goes...

            Render Buffers:
                Depth Buffer:
                    - part of the frame buffer
                ColorBuffer:
                    - where all the color goes

                Other:
                    Accumulation Buffer:
                        - repeated blending of whole images (motion blur)
                    Stencil Buffer:
                        - do stencil test
                        - tests between stencil buffer and depth buffer and conditionally discard fragment.
                
        Mehod:
            - create our own frame buffer off screen.
            - attach render buffers to it. (depth, color)
            - the color buffer is a texture.


        Graph:
                    | FBO |     Frame buffer object
                   /       \
              | RBO |    | Text |  Render buffer,  Texture object
                 |           |
  (FBO's depth buffer)    (color buffer)

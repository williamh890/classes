Shaders:
    communications with shaders:
        - uniform and attribute have 'location'

        attribute:
            - per vertex input to application

        uniform: 
            - per-primative data
            - sent from application to vertex/fragment shaders

        varying:
            - between vertex shader and fragment shader

            Process:
              - vertex shader sets variable
              - fragment shader reads it
    fog:
        - as things get farther away, they get more grey

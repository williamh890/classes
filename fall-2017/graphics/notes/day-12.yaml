Lift Chart:
    make:
        - need lift factor for each possible sample size
          (one instance at a time)
        - for each, calc the response rate/lift factor so far.

        Note:
            - x-axis sample size.
            - y-axis is lift factor.
            - result is a lift chart.

Cost Benifit Chart:
    - these are things that weka can generate.
    - shows whether more training is worth the increase in performace.

Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC):
    - signal to noise ratio in a communication channel.
    - compares true positives to false positives.

    note:
        - multiple ROC curves can be used to cmpr dm algos.
    Plots:
        - FP(False Positive) rate on x-axis.
        - TP(True Positive) rate on y-axis.

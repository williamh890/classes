Textures:
    - image that can be painted onto a polygon (or generalization)

Coords:
    polygon: (x, y)
    texture: (s, t)
    note: texture coords are attributes of each vertex.

    Resolution Independent Lookup:
        - values can still be gotten if lookup is between texels.
        - i.e. use closest, linear interpolate, ...

    note:
        - texturing effects are applied in the fragment shader.
    Steps:
        - Create a texture image
        - Application side 
        - Shader side

    Parameters:
        - control texture lookup (texture2D) when texel not hit exactly

    MagFilter:
        - texels are bigger than pixels
        Options:
            nearest: the nearest texel is picked
            linear: linearInterp between texels

    MinFilter:
        - texels are smaller than pixels
        Options:
            - nearest/linear (same as MagFilter)
            - nearest/mipmap-nearest
            - nearest/minmap-linear
            - linear/mipmap-nearest
            - linear/mipmap-linear

    WebGL object:
        - wrapper around allocated space on/in graphics hardware memory.


MipMap:
    - collection of images with different levels

Levels:
    level 0: full rez
    level 1: 1/2 rez
    level 2: 1/4 rez

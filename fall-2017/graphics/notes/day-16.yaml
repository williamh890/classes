Fuzzy Blob (example):
    Techniques:
        Billboarding - Face polygon towards the camera (spherical, cylindrical, oriented spherical).
            Steps (spherical):
                - find camera position
                - find vector from normal to camera
            Steps (cylindrical):
                - set y component to 0
                - do cylindrical billboarding

    Steps:
        Generate fuzzy blob texture:
            - user bunch of math to generate textures
            - see final code

Blending: 
    - enable and set up how it workds
    call:
        gl.enable(gl.BLEND)
        gl.blendFunc(sfactor, dfactor):
            sfactor: source color.
            dfactor: color that is in the frame buffer.

            note: ^ both these take gl constants

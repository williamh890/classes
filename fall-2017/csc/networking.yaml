Networking:
    Layers:
        - 7 layers total
        - 1,4 are really what we care about.

    Layer 4 (trasport):
        TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):
            - Trustworthy service to get data.

            
        UDP: Data is not sure to arive. 
        ICMP: basically ping...
            - useful to check connection
            - ping 8.8.8.8 (google server)

    Layer 3 (networking):
        lo: loopback
            - used to send yourself packets
        IP Address:
            - internet protocol address

        Netmask/Subnet Mask:
            - closesly related to IP address
            - used to determine valid ip's for 
              network.
            - can be done w/ binary math or tools. 
            - used to break big netorks up into smaller 
              networks.

        CIDR Prefix:
            - 2 digit number used to represent subnet mask
            - subnet mask determines number of hosts.

        NAT (Network Address Translation):
            - makes IPV4 usable.
            - used to translate private to public ips.

            Public IP:
                - IP that everyone outside network sees.
                  shared by all systems no the network.
                - unique on the internet. 
            Private IP:
                - Used to identify system on network. Only makes
                  sense inside the network.
                - no unique on internet.

        Reserved Addresses:
            - reseved for use within internal networks. 
            - VLSM is a thing. 

        Network Classes:
            - A, B, and C

    Layer 2 (Data Link):
        MAC Address:
            - unique id for network interface card (NIC)

        ARP Table:
            - Maps ip to mac address.

    Layer 1 (Physical Layer):
        - wires (or radios) that connect your device to the network.
        - Hubs a thing.

    Solarius:
        - oracals operating system.

    Networking Commands:
        ping:
            - sends packet and waits for reply.
            - usful for checking for connectivity.
        ifconfig:
            show interfaces on machine.
            - conrtol interfaces
            - <interface> up or down will do this.
            - '-a' shows all 

        netcat (nc):
            - make connections to arbitrary servers on arbitrary ports.
            - can be used to check filewalls.
            - nc <url> port

        nslookup:
            dnslookup <url>
        
        netstat:
            shows active connections on computer.
            flags: tulpan
                example: netstat -tulpan

        mtr:
            - ping and traceroute combined.
        nmap:
            - port scanner
            - could be view as an offensive act

            Exapmle:
              nmap -sV ww.cs.uaf.edu -p 80

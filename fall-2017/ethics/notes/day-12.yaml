Usability:
    - composite of a lot of different fields
    - design, interface, user experience, ...

    Def:
        - degree in which something is easy to use
        - quality characteristic

    User Experience (UX) Designers:
        - target user experience on an emotional level.
        - adds context/story to user natural behavior.

        The Five Planes:
            - user experience should be what the user expects
            Planes:
                - surface: just a bunch of webpages.
                - skeleton: placement of content on page (text, buttons, images).
                - structure: defines how the different pages are connected together.
                - scope: way different features of site fit together. 
                - strategy: the big picture idea of the site, for both the users and the host.
                     
            - projects are built from the bottom to the top, and are dependent on the planes 
              below it.

    Concepts:
        - keep concepts simple and standard.
        - visible and self evident(no instructions needed).
        - efficiency (easy to start, hard to master).
        - automate as much as possible.
        - know when to break the rules.

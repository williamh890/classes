Human Computer Interaction (HCI):
    Methodologies:
        Activity Theory:
            - context in which h c interaction take place.
            - framework to reason about actions in these context.
            - basing on activities that the user needs to do.

            - action relies on a network of actors.
                - tools, people, ideas

        User Centered Design:
            - system designed around the user.
            - iterated until all user requirements are met.
            
            Structure:
                - ui should be organized in a logical clean way.
            Simplicity:
                - common tasks should be easy.
            Visibilty:
                - all important features should be visible
                - this is also simplicity
            Feedback:
                - relay information back to the user.
            Toolerance:
                - should be flexible, ability to undo/redo actions.

        Value Sensitive Design:
            - cover this later.

        Peak-End Rule:
            - judge experiences by peak (worst/best) experiences.
            - boost peak moments.

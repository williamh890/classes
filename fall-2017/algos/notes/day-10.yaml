Linked List:
    Basics:
        Inserting:
            - ll = linear time
            - array = constant time

            note: in ll, its fast.

        Dtors:
            - destructor calls recusivly delete items in the ll.
            - if ll too long then stack can fill up. 

Recursion and Searching:
    Recursive:
        - algo that makes use of itself.
        - must have a base case to exit.
        - every thing else, recusive case.

        Direct: calls itself.
        Indirect: calls a function that calls the parent func.

        Note:
            - base case must always be reached.

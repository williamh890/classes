Priority Queue:
    - almost the same as queue.
    - retrieved item is the value with the greatest key.
    
    note: 
        - not a queue!
        - this is a restricted access sequence.

    - can only retrieve/delete greatest element.

    uses:
        - can be used to sort.
        - find the 'best' next option.
        - can partially sort/add data while sorting

    Implementation:
        - binary heap

Binary Heap:
    - complete binary tree ( all full, except last level;
                             level gets filled up from left to right )
    - allow duplicate keys.

    Max Heap:
        - the parent is larger than its children.
    Min Heap:
        - switch the relation

    Note: 
        - can be stored in an array
        - only need arithmetic to find a way around the heap

    Operations:
        get top:
            - first item in array
            time: constant

        insert:
            - insert the value in the next position that makes it complete
            sift-up:
                method: 
                    while value bigger than parent:
                        - swap nodes
                    else:
                        - break
            time: log -> if no realloc

        Delete:
            - get ride of last node
            - swap item to delete and last node
            sift-down:
                while node is gt largest child:
                    - swap
                else:
                    - done

            time: log

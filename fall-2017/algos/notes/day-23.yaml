2-3 Trees:
    Delete:
        Easy: just delete (leaf) |X| |
        Semi:                                              | | 
            - two siblings, one with 1, other with 2      // ^\ 
            - delete the one with 1                     |X|  | | |
            - rotate parent to deleted leaf down, 
              and the left box with two up           

        Hard:
            - bring item down from parent and recursively 'delete' in parent

    Efficiency:
        binary: 
            retrieve: constant
            insert: log n
            delete: log n
        2-3 Tree:
            retrieve: log n
            insert: log n
            delete: log n

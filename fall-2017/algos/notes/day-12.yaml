Algorithmic Efficiency and Sorting:
    Efficiency:
        - something that uses a few resources.

        Resources:
            - something that is limited. 
            - in algos, usually this is time.
            - can also be memory efficient
    
    Way to measure independent of hardware?:
        Steps counted:
            - basic operations
            - the largest exponent in a formula

        Input Size:
            - how does this effect runtime?

        Worst-Case Behavior:
            - max ops for a given sized input.

    Model of Computation:
        operations:
            - counting base c++ ops
        basic operations: 
            - built in type ops


    Big-O Notation:
        - Algorithm A is order f(n) [written O(f(n))]

        - A performs no more than k*f(n) basic ops n >= n0.
        this ignores small sized sets.

        - analyzig worst case.
        - also can analyze avg cases.

Invisible Functions II:
    The Rule of Five:
        - If you define one of the big five, you should define them all
        - this is a pain...

    The Rule of Zero:
        - Where possible, use already written RAII classes.

    noexcept: a promise that a function will not throw an exception.

Error Handling:
    - error condition is a condition while a prog is running that 
      cannot be handled by the normal flow of execution
    - not a bug, or indication that the user did something wrong.

    Dealing with Errors:
        - prevent errors
        - handle them when the occur
        - signal client code
        Types of signals:
            - error codes
            - setting flags
            - best of all... throw exception

    Guarantees:
        - errors conditions will not wreck the prog ( basic guarantee )
        - operation either completes entierly or nothing happends ( strong guarentee )
        - never inform client code of errors at all ( no-throw guarentee )

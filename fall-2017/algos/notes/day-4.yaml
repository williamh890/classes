Software Engineering Concepts:
    Testing:
        To know the worth of code, need to be able to test.
    
    PRIORITY:
        - get the code to compile! 
        - continually get code to compile.
        - get it finished after that.

    Test-Driven Development:
        - First write a test to see if it works,
        - make sure that test fails,
        - then make the test pass.

        Note: Unit testing done with "catch.hpp".

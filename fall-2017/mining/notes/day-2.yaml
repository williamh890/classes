Feilded Applications:
    A survey of some practiacal systems that have been implimented.

    Web Mining:
        Companies: Google, Facebook

        Concept:
            Giantic mass of data constantly being analyzed.

    Money Lending:
        Surveying people to see if person is going to pay money back

        Concept:
            Analyze surveys that people have already taken, which the outcome
            is already known. Predication based off that.

    Screening Images:
        Process an image to find oil slicks.

        Trainable:
            The system could be tweaked to identify different things,
            not just slicks.
        Note:
            type 1 vs. type 2 error: false positive vs. false negative.
            examples:
                -oil was there, didn't find it.
                -fould oil there, none actually there.
                
    Load Forcasting:
        Predict the demand for electricity

        Concept:
            Only generate electricity when the system needs it.

        Note:
            Model was built to predict this.

    Note:
        System is developed until further accuracy is more costly then the benifits
        the accuracy would give.

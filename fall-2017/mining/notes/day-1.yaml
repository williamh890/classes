    Project and Papers:
        Use some data from asf to get an original data set to analyz

        Ruberics:
            on the website.
    Book:
        The book is essentially a manual for free software
        Note:
            There are youtube videos going over thing more in depth from the book
    Test:
        Dates are fixed for projects and tests.

Data Mining and Machine learning:
    Data Mining:
        Goal:
            Discover patterns in data
        Patterns:
            Meaningful, that they lead to some advantage.
            what category? relation to other instances?
        Note:
            Good pattern allow us to make predictions on new data.
    Machine Learning (Pattern Discovery):
        Goal:
            Mimic human inteligence.
        Algorithms designed to look through data for patterns

        Note:
            Machine learning is a loaded term

    Expressoins of Patterns:
        Terms:
            black box, transparent box.

        Black Box:
            The method doesn't expain the results, even if it does give them
            Example:
                Genetic Algo

        Transparent Box:

            Method that shows the structure of the data and along with giving
            results along with increases the human understanding of the data.

            Note:
                Algo needs to explain stituation.

        Describing Structual Patterns:
            Example (unrealastic):
                Lookup Table

            In the real world, there are too many variables/options to model data
            w/ simple lookup table.

            Example:
                Set of rules.

            Example:
                Graphically with a descition tree.

            Example:
                first 5 col are dependent variables.
                6th on is the dependent output.

Simple Examples:
    Weather and other Problems:
        The weather problem

        variables:
            (outlook, temp, humidity, windy) -> play

            Note: The outlook depends on the other colomns.

        Descition List:
            Organized if/then rule serially to represent the structure of the data.

            Note:
                Exaulity: Boil down to yes/no questions.
                Inequality: If numeric values are presnet

        Assosiation Rules:
            How independtend variables affect the outcome

    Representing Structure:
        exahstive listing of all cases contains all of the "knowledge" in the problem,
        but it doesn't need to be organized.

    Descition Tree:
        Vertex: is a comparision.
        Conclusions: are leafs

    Visualizations: Charts, Rules, Trees

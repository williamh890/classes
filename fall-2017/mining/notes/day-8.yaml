Combine A and B:
    note: 1/n and 1- (1/n) sum to 1

    - Combine A and B for monte carlo simulation
    
    Combine Data Mining Algos:
        - gives ROC value (FP, FN ration) that lies 1/nth 
          tangent point away.

Recall and Presision:
    - information reterival

    Recall:
        - num of relecent docs retrived /
          total num of relevant docs
    Presision:
        - num of relevant docs retrieved / 
          total num of docs retrived
        
    note: 
        - increaes relevant docs retreived by increasing number of docs.
        - but proportion of relevent docs also falls.

    The F-Measure:
        - (2*recall*precision) / (recall+precision) => (2*TP) / (2*TP + FP + FN)
        - big is good.

    Success Rate:
        - (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FN + FP)
        - good outcomes over everything

Cost Curves:
    - How to factor cost into roc curve.

    Goal: Compare cost in comparing data mining algos

    Error Curve (5.5a):
        - really compliacted graph in book.
        - says intervales when to use stupid predictor,
          your algo, or just always say yes
    
    Cost Curve (5.5b):
        note: 
            - x-axis is a function of cost
            - y-axis is another function ontop of the function of cost

        Pc[+] -> X-axis cost curve:
            - prob(yes) * cost(FN) / 
              prob(yes) * cost(FN) + prob(no) * cost(FP) =>

            -                     cost if all y's falesy classified as no /
              cost if all y's falesy classified as no + cost if all no's were falesy classified as yeses

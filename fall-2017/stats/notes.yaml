Statisctic:
    Goal:
        Make inferiences about a population based on a finite set
        observations.

    Inferences:
        Def: Estimating parameters (describe characteristics) 
        Examples: AVG, MAX, MIN

        Testing Hypo: Drawing conclusions.

    Uncertanty:
        Goal: 
            Messure the accuarcy of an iferences

    Vocabulary/Definitions:
        population:
            All individuals, objects, or measurements that are of intrest.

        Sample:
            Any subset of the population.

            Note: Sample must be representitive of the population.
            Note: Sample Inferes about a population.
    
        Enumerative:
            A numerative study is a concrete population.
           
            Example:
                BMI of us 6th graders in 2017
            Population:
                US 6th graders
            Sample:
                Select 500 students.
                Comparisions:
                    boys vs. girls, east vs. west

        Analytical:
            time until onset of symptoms when someone is infected with malaria
           
            Population:
                All people -> time until symptoms.
            Sample:
                Example:
                    possible: When infections reported.
                    type: observational
                    note: Eithically good, but statitically bad.
                Example:
                    possible: infect people then watch
                    type: experimental
                    note: Ethically bad but statistically good.
               
        Variable:
            Def:
                Characteristic that is not constant among individuals in a population
            
            Types:
                Discrete:
                    Takes a finite or countably-inifinite number of values.

                    Exapmles:
                        finite: # of heads in 10 flips of a coin
                        countable-inifite: # of flips until first heads     
                    
                    Catigorical(Discrete):
                        non-numeric, discrete

                        Examples:
                            political affiliation: red, blue
                            sex: male, female
                Continuous:
                    Possible values on an interval of real numbers

                    Example: mesurments (dist, weight, time)i

        Sampling:
            Simple Random Sample (SRS):
                (of size n)

            Def:
                Every group of n individuals in a population has the same
                chance of being selected.

            Stratified Sample:
                Divide the population into groups and do SRS on all the groups
                proportionally.

IDescribing Distributions:
    Population Distribution:
        All possible values a variable can take in a population
        and how ofthen (frequency) of the % of time (relative frequency)
        that it takes each value.

    Sample Distribution:
        All values variable took in a sample + frequency of relative 
        frequency.

        Summarizing (quantitative data):
            Table:
                List possible values in discrete categories/intervales then 
                calculate the frequency/relative frequency in each intervale.

            Plots (graphical):
                Histograms:
                    graphical reprentation of data. x-axis intervale, y-axis frequency. 
                    
                    Note: 
                        Histogram vary from sample to sample but they should share 
                        the same general characteristics
                    Note:
                        The more samples taken, the better the histogram will reprentate
                        the population
                Example:
                      BTU          Frequency      Relative Frequency
                    40 -< 60           8           8 / 50 = 0.16
                    60 -< 80           10         10 / 50 = 0.20   
                    80 -< 100          16                   0.32
                   100 -< 120          9                    0.18 
                   120 -< 140          5                    0.10
                   140 -< 160          2                    0.04     
                
                Stem and Leaf:
                    Leaves: right most digit of each observation.
                    Stem: remaining digits
                    
                    Example:
                        4 | 5
                        5 | 0, 1, 4, 5, 5, 5, 8
                        6 | 0, 2, 4, 6, 6, 7, 9
                        7 | 5, 7, 8
                        8 | 0, 1, 3, 3, 6, 7
                        9 | 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 9
                       10 | 0, 1, 2 ,4, 9
                       11 | 1, 1, 3, 3
                       12 | 5, 9

Numerical Summaries (Center):
    Notation:
        Population:
            x1, x2, x3,...,xN

            N: Population size
        Sample:
            x1, x2, ...xn

            n: Sample Size

        Summation:
            (just sigma notation)
    
    Measures of Center:
        Mean:
            Average value.

            population mean: mu (looks like a u)
            sample mean: xbar (x w/ bar in top)
            
            Note: xbar != mu

        Median:
            def: 50% are above 50% are below
            
            Population Median:
                notaion: mu~ (u w/ a ~ on top)

            Sample Median:
                notation: x~ (x w/ a ~ on top)

            Finding:
                1: order from smallest to largest.
                2: if n is odd -> x~ is ((n+1) / 2) ordered observation
                   else       -> x~ is the mean of (n / 2) and ((n+2)/2)
            Notes:
                Symmetric Distribution:
                    mu = mu~

                Skewed Distribution:
                    mu~ < mu
                
        Example:
            Weekly salaries n=8 people

            values: 350, 410 ,460, 525, 545, 720, 760, 800

            mean:
                xbar = 1/8(sum(values)) = 571.25

            median:
                x~ = (1/2)(525+545) = 535

        Add observtion:

            new centers:
                xbar = 785.56
                x~ = 545

Measures of Variability:
    different population can look the same, and have the same center
    but they can be different.

    Example:
        Sample1: -2,-1,0,1,2
        Sample2: -100,-50,0,50,100

    Range:
        max(sample) - min(sample)
        
        Sample1: 2 - (-2) = 4
        Sample2: 200

        Exception:
            -100, -99, -98, -97, --> 100 <--
            
            Note: The range is 200, but this is not representative

    Variance:
        population variance:
            omega^2 = (1/N) * SUM(xi - mu)^2

        sample variance:
            S^2 = (1/n-1) * SUM(xi - xbar)^2

        Ave squared deviation

    Define:
        sxx = sum(xi - xbar)^2
            = sum(xi^2) - (1/n) * (sum(xi))^2
            
        so S^2 = (1/(n-1))*sxx


    Standard Deviation:
        s = sqrt(s^2) --> average deviation from mean.

        Example:
            sample: 6, 1, 3, 5, 5

            xi = sum(sample) = 20
            xi^2 = sum([s^2 for s in sample])= 96

            S^2 = 96 - (1/5) * 20^2 = 16
            S = 4


Measures of loaction and variability:
    5-Number Summary:
        min: smallest value
        Q1: lower 4th - value in sample so that 25% of values are less then it.
        Q2: Median    - 50% less then Q2
        Q3: Upper 4th - 75% less then upper fourth
        Max: largest value

        Example:
            Weekly incomes, n=9

                    Min     Q1 |        Q2
                    -----------------------
            values: 350, 410, 460, 525, 545, 720, 760, 800, 2500
                                        ------------------------
                                                Q3 |         Max
            5-Number summary:
                min: 350
                Q1: 460
                Q2: 545
                Q3: 760 
                Max: 2500
        
        Fourth Spread:
            Range of middle 50% of the values

            Equation:
                fs = Q3 - Q1


            Example:
                fs = 760 - 460 = 300

        Box Plot:
            graphical representation of the 5-Num summary (with a little extra)
            
            Note:
                all box plots should include outliers!!

            Outliers:
                Any observation in a sample that falls more then (1.5*fs) below Q1 or (1.5*fs) above Q3

            Example: fs = 300
                below: 460 - 1.5*300 = 10 -> No outliers here!
                above: 760 + 1.5*300 = 1210 -> 1200 is an outlier!

            The plot:
                box: definied by q1,q2,q3
                whiskers: farthest none-outlier values in dataset.
                outliers: denoted with *

                Example:
                    | 
                    | 
                    |              _____ ________

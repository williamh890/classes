Statisctic:
    Goal:
        Make inferiences about a population based on a finite set
        observations.

    Inferences:
        Def: Estimating parameters (describe characteristics) 
        Examples: AVG, MAX, MIN

        Testing Hypo: Drawing conclusions.

    Uncertanty:
        Goal: 
            Messure the accuarcy of an iferences

    Vocabulary/Definitions:
        population:
            All individuals, objects, or measurements that are of intrest.

        Sample:
            Any subset of the population.

            Note: Sample must be representitive of the population.
            Note: Sample Inferes about a population.
    
        Enumerative:
            A numerative study is a concrete population.
           
            Example:
                BMI of us 6th graders in 2017
            Population:
                US 6th graders
            Sample:
                Select 500 students.
                Comparisions:
                    boys vs. girls, east vs. west

        Analytical:
            time until onset of symptoms when someone is infected with malaria
           
            Population:
                All people -> time until symptoms.
            Sample:
                Example:
                    possible: When infections reported.
                    type: observational
                    note: Eithically good, but statitically bad.
                Example:
                    possible: infect people then watch
                    type: experimental
                    note: Ethically bad but statistically good.
               
        Variable:
            Def:
                Characteristic that is not constant among individuals in a population
            
            Types:
                Discrete:
                    Takes a finite or countably-inifinite number of values.

                    Exapmles:
                        finite: # of heads in 10 flips of a coin
                        countable-inifite: # of flips until first heads     
                    
                    Catigorical(Discrete):
                        non-numeric, discrete

                        Examples:
                            political affiliation: red, blue
                            sex: male, female
                Continuous:
                    Possible values on an interval of real numbers

                    Example: mesurments (dist, weight, time)i

        Sampling:
            Simple Random Sample (SRS):
                (of size n)

            Def:
                Every group of n individuals in a population has the same
                chance of being selected.

            Stratified Sample:
                Divide the population into groups and do SRS on all the groups
                proportionally.

IDescribing Distributions:
    Population Distribution:
        All possible values a variable can take in a population
        and how ofthen (frequency) of the % of time (relative frequency)
        that it takes each value.

    Sample Distribution:
        All values variable took in a sample + frequency of relative 
        frequency.

        Summarizing (quantitative data):
            Table:
                List possible values in discrete categories/intervales then 
                calculate the frequency/relative frequency in each intervale.

            Plots (graphical):
                Histograms:
                    graphical reprentation of data. x-axis intervale, y-axis frequency. 
                    
                    Note: 
                        Histogram vary from sample to sample but they should share 
                        the same general characteristics
                    Note:
                        The more samples taken, the better the histogram will reprentate
                        the population
                Example:
                      BTU          Frequency      Relative Frequency
                    40 -< 60           8           8 / 50 = 0.16
                    60 -< 80           10         10 / 50 = 0.20   
                    80 -< 100          16                   0.32
                   100 -< 120          9                    0.18 
                   120 -< 140          5                    0.10
                   140 -< 160          2                    0.04     
                
                Stem and Leaf:
                    Leaves: right most digit of each observation.
                    Stem: remaining digits
                    
                    Example:
                        4 | 5
                        5 | 0, 1, 4, 5, 5, 5, 8
                        6 | 0, 2, 4, 6, 6, 7, 9
                        7 | 5, 7, 8
                        8 | 0, 1, 3, 3, 6, 7
                        9 | 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 9
                       10 | 0, 1, 2 ,4, 9
                       11 | 1, 1, 3, 3
                       12 | 5, 9

Numerical Summaries (Center):
    Notation:
        Population:
            x1, x2, x3,...,xN

            N: Population size
        Sample:
            x1, x2, ...xn

            n: Sample Size

        Summation:
            (just sigma notation)
    
    Measures of Center:
        Mean:
            Average value.

            population mean: mu (looks like a u)
            sample mean: xbar (x w/ bar in top)
            
            Note: xbar != mu

        Median:
            def: 50% are above 50% are below
            
            Population Median:
                notaion: mu~ (u w/ a ~ on top)

            Sample Median:
                notation: x~ (x w/ a ~ on top)

            Finding:
                1: order from smallest to largest.
                2: if n is odd -> x~ is ((n+1) / 2) ordered observation
                   else       -> x~ is the mean of (n / 2) and ((n+2)/2)
            Notes:
                Symmetric Distribution:
                    mu = mu~

                Skewed Distribution:
                    mu~ < mu
                
        Example:
            Weekly salaries n=8 people

            values: 350, 410 ,460, 525, 545, 720, 760, 800

            mean:
                xbar = 1/8(sum(values)) = 571.25

            median:
                x~ = (1/2)(525+545) = 535

        Add observtion:
            values.append(785.56)

            new centers:
                xbar = 785.56
                x~ = 545

                    Note:
                        Like a histogram on its side.

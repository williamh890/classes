Measures of Variability:
    different population can look the same, and have the same center
    but they can be different.

    Example:
        Sample1: -2,-1,0,1,2
        Sample2: -100,-50,0,50,100

    Range:
        max(sample) - min(sample)
        
        Sample1: 2 - (-2) = 4
        Sample2: 200

        Exception:
            -100, -99, -98, -97, --> 100 <--
            
            Note: The range is 200, but this is not representative

    Variance:
        population variance:
            omega^2 = (1/N) * SUM(xi - mu)^2

        sample variance:
            S^2 = (1/n-1) * SUM(xi - xbar)^2

        Ave squared deviation

    Define:
        sxx = sum(xi - xbar)^2
            = sum(xi^2) - (1/n) * (sum(xi))^2
            
        so S^2 = (1/(n-1))*sxx


    Standard Deviation:
        s = sqrt(s^2) --> average deviation from mean.

        Example:
            sample: 6, 1, 3, 5, 5

            xi = sum(sample) = 20
            xi^2 = sum([s^2 for s in sample])= 96

            S^2 = 96 - (1/5) * 20^2 = 16
            S = 4


Measures of loaction and variability:
    5-Number Summary:
        min: smallest value
        Q1: lower 4th - value in sample so that 25% of values are less then it.
        Q2: Median    - 50% less then Q2
        Q3: Upper 4th - 75% less then upper fourth
        Max: largest value

        Example:
            Weekly incomes, n=9

                    Min     Q1 |        Q3
                    -----------------------
            values: 350, 410, 460, 525, 545, 720, 760, 800, 2500
                                        ------------------------
                                                Q3 |         Max
            5-Number summary:
                min: 350
                Q1: 460
                Q2: 545
                Q3: 760 
                Max: 2500
        
        Fourth Spread:
            Range of middle 50% of the values

            Equation:
                fs = Q3 - Q1


            Example:
                fs = 760 - 460 = 300

        Box Plot:
            graphical representation of the 5-Num summary (with a little extra)
            
            Note:
                all box plots should include outliers!!

            Outliers:
                Any observation in a sample that falls more then (1.5*fs) below Q1 or (1.5*fs) above Q3

            Example: fs = 300
                below: 460 - 1.5*300 = 10 -> No outliers here!
                above: 760 + 1.5*300 = 1210 -> 1200 is an outlier!

            The plot:
                box: definied by q1,q2,q3
                whiskers: farthest none-outlier values in dataset.
                outliers: denoted with *

                Example:
                    | 
                    | 
                    |              _____ ________
